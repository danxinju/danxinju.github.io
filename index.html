	<h1>I am from the future and I would like to tell you: <strong>app</strong> is dead and <strong>web</strong> is in full bloom</h1>
	<p class="strong">Most of company has already upgraded their services from CS to BS. But on the smart phone, they go back to CS again, it's anti-Internet and historical retrogression.</p>

	<h2>Cause of death</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>App is closed, like a lonely island. You can't link other apps easily and the content can not be indexed by the search engine.</li>
		<li>App is expensive, we need to find it in the app market and download a big install file, data traffic is precious. Especially the Android, so many app markets makes me crazy.</li>
		<li>App is boring, we already have enough notifications in the life and battery is precious. Life is short, we don't need to spend time on the settings and cache cleaning.</li>
		<li>App is terrible, like a bloodsucker will upload the video, photo, document and file privately to the own server, evesdropping is unethical!</li>
		<li>App is complex, you need to employ the IOS and Android engineers and do double work to build it. Undoubtedly the cost is very expensive, especially for a small company.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="strong">Now I would like to say: enough! We need a simple and better way to implement the requirement.</p>


	<h2>Better Web</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Web standards are making the compatibility work less and less, code once, run anywhere.</li>
		<li>HTML(5+) is making the functionality stronger and stronger.</li>
		<li>Hardware technology is making the performance better and better.</li>
		<li>Sandbox is safe, code can access nothing from your device without the authorization.</li>
		<li>Open information is making the universal database(like Google Search) is larger and larger.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="strong">I know most of app is native in the world you are living, but it is not the future. No hurry, just remember that the most important factor is Open and Standard.</p>
